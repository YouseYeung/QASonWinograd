27. Susan knew that Ann's son had been in a car accident, [so/because] she told her about it. Who told the other about the accident? 
(KB: If person A knows sth, person A might tell sth to somebody. If person A tells person B srth, person B knows sth.)
Answers: Susan/Ann.
Comment: There is a large literature on "implicit causality" and "implicit consequentiality" biases (see, for example, (Hartshorne, 2013), (Kehler et al. 2008)), in which a comprehender obtains a preference for the antecedent of a pronoun in a second clause based on the content of the first clause and the connective, before seeing the content of the second clause. These are often associated with "so" and "because". For example seeing:

"Sally frightened Mary because she ..." people interpret "she" as Sally. 
"Sally loves Mary because she ..." people interpret "she" as Mary. 
"Sally frightened Mary, so she ..." people interpret "she" as Mary. 
"Sally loves Mary, so she ..." people interpret "she" as Sally. 
If there are biases that favor the correct disambiguation in our example here, and if the direction of the biases can be determined purely from linguistic characteristics of the first clause e.g. from the use of the verb "knew", then this is not a valid Winograd schema, because an automated understander could do better than chance on this without employing world knowledge. However, I currently have no reason to think that this is the case.

                          "uncle younger"   9,630,000 
                          "older"         357,000,000 
                          "younger"        93,000,000
Thus "uncle" is not particularly associated with "older".

(KB:??)
Answers: The guy in the uniform/Jim.
Comment: If you stop the second sentence at "I don't know [who/why] he was" you still have the same ambiguity, but it becomes very difficult to ask the question. "I don't know who who was?'' is perhaps best. Of course, either way there is a reading in which the two ``he'' refer to different people, but it seems to me that that's considerably less preferred.

Answers:the sheep/the shepherds.
Comment: It may be objected that this can be solved using the distance in the semantic hierarchy rather than reasoning about the actual visual appearance. Example 137 below avoids that objection, but is perhaps more difficult for the human reader. In any case, a program that reasons that similar looking objects are apt to be close in the semantic hierarchy is, I would say, solving the problem in a perfectly reasonable way. A program that reasons ignores the "looks like" relation and just reasons, "The referent of an anaphora is likely to be close in a semantic hierarchy to some nearby word in the sentence" is not solving the problem in a reasonable way, and is employing a fragile heuristic that is easily broken by rearranging the sentence. For example, if we reword the above "Sam tried to paint a picture of shepherds with sheep, but they ended up looking to Wilma more like [dogs/golfers]" where this heuristic will in all cases look for a referent semantically close to "Wilma".

Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses; and her place had been taken by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.
Note that the original presents two further difficult disambiguation problems, with the second and third "her"'s in the sentence. Winograd schema in the broad sense, since two separated words are replaced.

"because" & "not particularly": George 
"even though" & "particularly": George

I am a little doubtful about the intelligibility of "even though" with "not particularly", but the rest seem fine to me. David Bender points out that the difficulty in that case may be due to the fact that it is hard to find a motivation for George. Winograd schema in the broad sense.
